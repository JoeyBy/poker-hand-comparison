# poker-hand-comparison
a simple JS application. analyses who the winner is between two poker hands. 

hands are entered in short form. 
  (ex. AC would be the Ace of Clubs. 10 is referenced as T)
  
BUGS TO FIX:
  higher card values are not compared. for example... an ace high straight would return a tie with a 6 high straight.
  two pair does not register as a hand.
